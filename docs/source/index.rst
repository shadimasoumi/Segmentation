CatheterSegmentation
===================================

There are MATLAB functions here in **CatheterSegmentation** that segment layered structures (here layered structures are ball lens, catheter sheath inner and outer interfaces of polarization-based NvisionVLEÂ® Imaging System). "Graph Theory" is the basis of these functions.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section, :doc:`graphTheory` and :doc:`functions` for more explanation.
